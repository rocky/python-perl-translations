# python-perl-translations

A work colleague/friend, Eric Woodworth recently left a Python shop and will be working in a more Perl oriented place.

I culled together https://github.com/rocky/python-perl-translations/wiki/Python-to-Perl-translations but realize others may want to use and more importantly, _contribute_ to.
